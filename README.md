This is a simple page that consumes the [New York Times Books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/overview) to display info about the current best sellers lists. This project was developed in Next.js. I used it as a opportunity to try out the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
